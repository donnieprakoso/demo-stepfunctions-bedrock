# Build and Enrich Your Generative AI Apps with Visual Workflow 

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This repository holds all source code for demos that I use for my session at AWS Innovate AI/ML. 
I also wrote an article describing my [5 lessons learned in building generative AI application with a workflow](https://community.aws/content/2fiK2xJf773295nAEE9ecLgtvFP/5-lessons-learned-in-building-generative-ai-application-with-a-workflow). So, if you haven't read that article, I suggest you to read my post first to give you a bit of context. 

## Tl;dr: How to use this repo?

All of the demo is ready for you to deploy using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Once you have bootstrapped your account, the demos are fairly easy for you to deploy. Just run:

```
$> cdk deploy
```

...and it will ready for you to use.

And, if you no longer need it, you can simply run 

```
$> cdk destroy
```
